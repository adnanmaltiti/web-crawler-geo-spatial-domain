# web-crawler-geo-spatial-domain
A crawler must be implemented by each student to identify websites that make use of certain geospatial services, servers, data formats, etc. 1. Create a web application, using the results from Part 1, which allows a user to type in a URL the crawler should start crawling from. 2. For each starting URL, create a separate portal in your application that displays its search results. 3. The location (country) of the server hosting each visited URL must be noted. 4. Create a spatial database that stores each URL visited, the type and version of geospatial service, server, data formats, etc. used, the location of the server hosting the site (longitude and latitude). 5. Display on a web map the locations of the sites using the OGC WMS that you set up in Part 1. Create at least 3 layers for the visualization of each sub-section. Hint: Let your database have spatial columns to store longitude and latitude.
